# @freelensapp/ai-cli-extension

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

Run an AI CLI session scoped to any Kubernetes cluster, straight from the
Freelens sidebar. Select OpenCode, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot CLI; Freelens
launches selected provider in a docked terminal tab with `KUBECONFIG` wired and
provider-native files pre-seeded.

## Why

Operating Kubernetes clusters means switching between Freelens and a terminal
for AI-assisted work. This extension keeps provider sessions in Freelens while
leaving each cluster and provider with an isolated workspace.

## Features

- **Provider selection** — select OpenCode, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot CLI
  per cluster. Selection persists per cluster and can change at any time.
- **Per-cluster isolation** — each provider workdir is
  `<userData>/ai-cli-sessions/<safe-cluster-id>/<provider-id>/`.
- **Provider-native scaffolds** — registry entries declare managed editor files,
  reset paths, and bundled scaffolds for every provider.
- **In-app editors** — edit provider-declared instruction, permissions, and
  settings files with debounced autosave and theme matching.
- **Checks and retry** — provider availability is checked on `PATH`; missing or
  failed checks show retry action. Changing cluster or provider drops stale
  in-flight results.
- **Reveal workdir** — open only selected provider's validated workdir in native
  file manager.

CLI permission files are provider-native convenience guardrails. Kubernetes
RBAC and kubeconfig permissions remain security boundary.

## Quick start

### 1. Install a provider

Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/),
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup), or
[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli).
The extension detects providers via `PATH`; it does not bundle or update them.

### 2. Install the extension

Open Freelens, go to **Extensions**, and install extension archive.

### 3. Launch a session

Click **AI CLI** in any cluster sidebar, select an installed provider, then
open its session. Repeat per cluster; every provider workspace is independent.

## How it works

Each cluster and provider get a persistent workspace:

```
<userData>/ai-cli-sessions/<safe-cluster-id>/<provider-id>/
  <provider-native files>
```

`<safe-cluster-id>` replaces unsupported characters in the cluster ID and appends a short digest, preserving
isolation when different IDs sanitize to the same value.

On first open, the extension copies provider-native scaffold files into the
workdir. OpenCode uses `AGENTS.md` and `.opencode/opencode.json`; Claude Code
uses `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`; Copilot uses
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/copilot/settings.json`.

Edit declared files in Freelens or reveal workdir to use other tools. Provider
guardrails apply only within that CLI. They do not grant Kubernetes access or
replace RBAC and kubeconfig permissions.

**Reset:** removes and re-seeds only provider registry `resetPaths`: currently
`.opencode/opencode.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or
`.github/copilot/settings.json`. Instruction files and unrelated workspace
files remain unchanged.

# Video demo

**The situation:**
- Pod status: `CreateContainerConfigError` (new pod can't start)

**What the agent does:**
1. `kubectl get pods, get deployments, get events` — notices `CreateContainerConfigError`
2. Reads secret key error
3. Inspects keys
4. Identifies key mismatch: `DB_PASS` should be `DB_PASSWORD`
5. Fixes and waits for pod to come back healthy

</p>

**The situation:**
- Pod restarts: increasing restart count

**What the agent does:**
1. `kubectl get pods -n freelens-agent-demo` — notices restarts
2. `kubectl describe pod` shows `OOMKilled` with exit code 137
3. Inspects resource limits in deployment, identifies 16Mi as insufficient
4. Recommends bumping to 256Mi
5. Fixes: applies good deployment manifest
6. Verifies pod stabilizes
